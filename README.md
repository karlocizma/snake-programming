# snake-programming

This repository contains a collection of Python programs and tools focused on network security and web administration tasks.  These scripts are designed to simplify common tasks such as SSL certificate management, web server health checks, and email security configuration.

## Contents

* **pfx_to_pem:**  Converts PFX (PKCS#12) certificate files to PEM format.
* **ssl_checker:** Checks the validity and expiration dates of SSL certificates for given domains.
* **webserver_checker:**  Performs basic HTTP checks to verify the availability and responsiveness of web servers.
* **spf_dmarc_configurator:** Assists in generating and configuring SPF (Sender Policy Framework) and DMARC (Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting & Conformance) records for improved email security.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository:** `git clone https://github.com/your-username/snake-programming.git`
2. **Navigate to the specific program/tool directory:** `cd pfx_to_pem` (or `ssl_checker`, `webserver_checker`, `spf_dmarc_configurator`)
3. **Review the README within each directory for specific instructions and dependencies.** (Each tool should have its own README with details on usage, arguments, etc.)
